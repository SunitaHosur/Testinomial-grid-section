            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

          <p class="text-base text-grayish font-medium">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
            100% recommend! ”</p>
